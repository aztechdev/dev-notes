# On the Criteria To Be Used in decomposing Systems into Modules

> _By D.L. Parnas (Carnegie-Mellon University) ~1972_

This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time.

> _The effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules._

The aim of this paper is to figure out what the criteria is to divide a system into modules.

Today it is possible to program in a way that:

1. Allows for a module to be written with little knowledge of the code in another module
2. Allows for modules to be reassembled and replaced without reassembly of the whole system

## Expected Benefits of Modular Programming

1. Managerial
   - development time should be shortened because separate groups would work on each module with little need for communication
2. Product flexibility
   - it should be possible to make drastic changes to one module without a need to change others
3. Comprehensibility
   - it should be possible to study the system one module at a time.

The whole system can therefore be better designed because it is better understood.
