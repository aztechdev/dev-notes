# Express Notes

[Express](https://expressjs.com/): It provides one of the most simple yet powerful ways to create a web server. Its minimalist approach, unopinionated, focused on the core features of a server, is key to its success.

[koa](http://koajs.com/): It is built by the same team behind Express, aims to be even simpler and smaller, building on top of years of knowledge. The new project born out of the need to create incompatible changes without disrupting the existing community.

[**Micro**](https://github.com/zeit/micro): It provides a very lightweight server to create asynchronous HTTP microservices.

[hapi](https://hapijs.com/): A rich framework for building applications and services that enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.
